Thanks for the opportunity and consideration for a role at Heron!

## Project Overview
This repository contains my deliverables for the Heron Product Ops take-home, focusing on post-implementation data-driven insights to communicate the value of the Heron platform and next steps for Bank of Small Business to maximize Heron platform value.

## Primary Deliverable
- [Post-implementation customer follow-up](./heron_data_launch_follow_up.md) - A comprehensive message with implementation metrics and strategic next steps for Bank of Small Business (BOSB)

## Supporting Documentation
- [Python Analysis](./heron_analysis.py) - Python code used to analyze customer data and generate insights
- [Heron Metrics Notes](./metrics_notes_analysis.xlsx) - Notes on Heron metrics
- [Project Notes](./project_notes.md) - Additional context and considerations for the solution
- [Written Notes](./written_notes.pdf) - Additional written notes 

## Solution Approach
My approach to this assignment focused on three key areas:
1. **Data-Driven Insights**: Identifying the most impactful metrics to highlight platform value
2. **Actionable Recommendations**: Converting insights into clear, prioritized next steps
3. **Customer Success Framework**: Creating a scalable model for ongoing customer engagement

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib) for data analysis
- Markdown for documentation

## Future Enhancements
Given more time, I would expand this solution to include:
- Additional post-implementation follow up messages (including customized content for personas)
- Deeper dive into analytics and segmentation to surface insights
- Updated links to documentation / resources
